# **Lab 4 Report**
## 1. *Expected Results*
> Here's a link to [my repository](https://github.com/quistian241/markdown-parse) and a link to [my copy of the tester repo](https://github.com/quistian241/markdown-parse-two-main).
> The expected results for each test is one link for `Snippet 1`, three valid links for `Snippet 2`  (not including b.com), and only one valid link in `Snippet 3`.

> Based on this info we made our testers to accomidate and expect outputs matching this info: ![the-testers-for-snippets](https://github.com/quistian241/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/lab_4_images/Lab4_3.png?raw=true)

## 2. *My Implementation Results*
> For `my repository` the results of running the tests was that of every test failing. Now while each tester for the three snippets failed there were no exceptions thrown, we only didn't get the expected outputs we wanted for each snippet. ![The_Image](https://github.com/quistian241/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/lab_4_images/Lab4_1.png?raw=true)

> Here are the extended jdb results of my stacktrace (note the line numbers have changed for MarkdownParseTest but that's only because I added coments that moved the testers):

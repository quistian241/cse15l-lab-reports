# **Lab 5 Report**
## 1. *How The Different Results Were Found*
> The results for the test were found relatively simply through the usage of the command `diff markdown-parse/results.txt markdown-parse-main-three/markdown-parse-main/results.txt` where the first class path is for my markdown-parse implementation and the secound classpath is for the provided one back in lab 9. One noteable change made to script.sh one that first prints out the file name and the test result on the same line. This change is one that allows you to identify not only the differences between the two files but know which .md file it coresponds to since they aren't always in order.
